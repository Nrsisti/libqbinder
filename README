libqbinder
==========

A library for using libgbinder from a Qt app.

If Qt is compiled to use QEventDispatcherGlib for event loop then Qt apps
can use libgbinder directly. However, if Qt is using QEventDispatcherUNIX
based event loop then libqbinder is required, since it provides integration
of libgbinder with Qt event loop in a way agnostic to the event dispatching
mechanism.
